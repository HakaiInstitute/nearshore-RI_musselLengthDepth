## Summary

This data package is a component of the Hakai Institute’s Nearshore research and monitoring program. The overarching objective of Hakai Nearshore research is to investigate the role of habitats and their associated communities, in the face of stress and disturbances from global climate change and local coastal perturbations. 

The Rocky Intertidal program is a subset of Hakai Nearshore, and is designed to quantify change in rocky shore intertidal habitats and their associated communities. Please see the list of all Rocky Intertidal program data packages here:

## Survey Methods

This data package collects data and information relating to mussel bed
surveys conducted in the rocky intertidal of Calvert Island BC, starting in 2016. Surveys were conducted using 5 permanent plots at each site, wherein mussel length and bed depth was measured in five subplots. For a detailed description, please see the Rocky Intertidal protocol contained in this dataset.
